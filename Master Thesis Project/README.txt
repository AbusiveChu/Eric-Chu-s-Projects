The thesis work can be broken up into 3 different sections:

1) Initial development modifying the Unreal Engine source code (Unreal Engine Source Files).

2) Switching to using a Plugin instead due to compile times (Plugin Files/BPAlt).

3) Project templates for the user study and a plugin to measure user inputs in controlled cases(Project Templates & Plugin Files/JustLogs).
